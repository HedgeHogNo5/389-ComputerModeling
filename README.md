# 389-ComputerModeling
 This code runs a simple Newton's cradle model. This was written for A university Modelling module Phys 389
 Classes.py contains all the classes that are used in this model: The particle CLass, teh Newton's Cradel CLass, and teh Pendulum Class.

 When wanting to use this code, users should first employ Test[0].py. This has may assert statemtns that are used to chack that the code is reacjing the correct values. This will help catch any errors in the running of such a code.

 Test[1].py can be run if you want to test the pendulum class. It will produce both printed output od the position, velocity, and acceleration of the particle into the terminal as well as produucing a graph once it has completed this

Test [2].py can be used ti test the Newton Cradel Class. It has two particles pre programmed and will produce a grpah of hiw the overall position velocity and acceleration of the 2 particles changes

 Test[3].py is also run to test the Pendulum class. Instead of rpinting to the terminal though, it will produce graphs of the position, velocity, and acceleration for the x, y, and z componants of these as well as the overall value. THis is good to see whether the pendulum's movement matches that of the theory of simple graitational pendulum

 Test[4].py is pre-programmed with a 5 particle newton's cradle and will simulate the particles position, velocity, and acceleration onto a grpah. All particles are on the same graph but use different colours to differenciate themselves. There is a lengend that lables the particles clearly

 Momentum test is an example of the implimentation of the momentum code that was used in collision detection. It does not interact woth any other file or class.

 Momentum and Kinetic Energy Graph will create a graph of how momentum and Kinetic energy change over time, it is currently coded with 2 particles.
